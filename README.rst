FancyLED is a CircuitPython library to assist in creating buttery smooth LED animation. It's loosely inspired by the FastLED library for Arduino, and in fact we have a "helper" library using similar function names to assist with porting of existing Arduino FastLED projects to CircuitPython.

Dependencies
=============
This driver depends on:

* `Adafruit CircuitPython <https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython>`_

Please ensure all dependencies are available on the CircuitPython filesystem.
This is easily achieved by downloading
`the Adafruit library and driver bundle <https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_Bundle>`_.

Installing from PyPI
====================

On supported GNU/Linux systems like the Raspberry Pi, you can install the driver locally `from
PyPI <https://pypi.org/project/adafruit-circuitpython-fancyled/>`_. To install for current user:

.. code-block:: shell

    pip3 install adafruit-circuitpython-fancyled

To install system-wide (this may be required in some cases):

.. code-block:: shell

    sudo pip3 install adafruit-circuitpython-fancyled

To install in a virtual environment in your current project:

.. code-block:: shell

    mkdir project-name && cd project-name
    python3 -m venv .venv
    source .venv/bin/activate
    pip3 install adafruit-circuitpython-fancyled

Usage Example
=============

See the examples in the examples/ folder.
