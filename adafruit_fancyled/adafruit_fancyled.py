====================================================

FancyLED is a CircuitPython library to assist in creating buttery smooth LED animation.
It's loosely inspired by the FastLED library for Arduino, and in fact we have a "helper"
library using similar function names to assist with porting of existing Arduino FastLED
projects to CircuitPython.

        WITH REGARD TO RGBW PIXELS, THIS PROBABLY DOESN'T DO WHAT YOU THINK.
        FancyLED is currently RGB-focused through and through and has no
        concept of RGBW. This function does NOT perform white component
        replacement on the RGB elements -- those values are returned
        unmodified, this just allows appending a white element to pass
        through to the NeoPixel setter with RGBW pixels.
        The reason for this peculiar return option is that the core NeoPixel
        library can't accept packed 32-bit values for RGBW, only 4-tuples.
        This is intentional and by design, because space-constrained devices
        don't support the full 32-bit integer range in CircuitPython (but
        24-bit RGB fits).
        Also note, if gamma_adjust() was applied to an RGB color that's then
        passed to this function, that adjustment is NOT automatically applied
        to the white element -- this must be explicitly handled in user code
        (gamma_adjust() can accept both tuples (for RGB) and single values
        (for white)).
